        //         Design pattern in software engineering is a general, reusable solution to a 
        //         commonly occurring problem in software design.

        //         Developers face some problems while developing applications or in the 
        //         software application Lifecycle which are common and repeated, for example, 
        //         creation and disposal of objects, interaction between objects, the structure 
        //         of classes that enhance cohesion and loose coupling, fixing of bugs in a way 
        //         that minimize changing of source codes, etc.

        //         Design patterns are used to solve these commonly occurring problems in the 
        //         development phase so that we can minimize the problems after deployment. 
        //         A design pattern suggests a specific implementation for the specific 
        //         object-oriented programming problem. For example, if you want to ensure that 
        //         only a single instance of a class exists, then you can use the Singleton 
        //         design pattern which suggests the best way to create a class that can only 
        //         have one object.

        //         Design principles are different than design patterns. 
        //         Learn the difference between design principles and design patterns.

        //         HOW TO USE DESIGN PATTERNS?

        //         You can use one design pattern or a combination of design patterns to solve a 
        //         problem in your software application. Each pattern has use cases that suggest 
        //         which pattern might be a good match for.

        //         A pattern might have positive or negative consequences. Implement a pattern 
        //         when it has more advantages than disadvantages for your problem.

        //         Sometimes two or more design patterns solve one problem. You have to compare 
        //         then understand their differences before implementing a design pattern.

        //         The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation 
        //         for all other patterns. The GoF refers to four authors (Erich Gamma, Richard 
        //         Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides) who published a book 
        //         "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" in 1994 that 
        //         is still used today.
        //     */

        //     /*
        //         TYPES OF DESIGN PATTERNS

        //         Design patterns are categorized into three groups: Creational, Structural, 
        //         and Behavioral. 
        //     */

        //     /*
        //         CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERNS 

        //         Creational design patterns solve problems related to object creation. 
        //         They help to abstract away object creation processes that spread across 
        //         multiple classes.

        //         The following five patterns are creational design patterns:

        //         1. Singleton
        //         2. Abstract Factory
        //         3. Builder
        //         4. Factory Method
        //         5. Prototype
        //     */

        //     /*
        //         STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERNS

        //         Structural design patterns suggest implementing relationships between classes 
        //         and objects.

        //         The following seven patterns are structural design patterns:

        //         1. Adapter
        //         2. Bridge
        //         3. Composite
        //         4. Decorator
        //         5. Facade
        //         6. Flyweight
        //         7. Proxy
        //     */

        //     /*
        //         BEHAVIORAL DESIGN PATTERNS

        //         The behavioral design patterns suggest ways of communication between classes and objects.

        //         The following twelve patterns are behavioral design patterns:

        //         1. Chain of Responsibility
        //         2. Command
        //         3. Interpreter
        //         4. Iterator
        //         5. Mediator
        //         6. Memento
        //         7. Observer
        //         8. State
        //         9. Strategy
        //         10. Template Method
        //         11. Visitor
        //         12. Mediator
