        //         C# includes the following generic collection classes in the 
        //         System.Collections.Generic namespace.

        //         Generic Collections	    Description

        //         List<T>	                Generic List<T> contains elements of specified type. 
        //                                 It grows automatically as you add elements in it.

        //         Dictionary<TKey,TValue>	Dictionary<TKey,TValue> contains key-value pairs.

        //         SortedList<TKey,TValue>	SortedList stores key and value pairs. 
        //                                 It automatically adds the elements in ascending order of key by default.

        //         Queue<T>	            Queue<T> stores the values in FIFO style (First In First Out). It keeps the order in which the values were added. 
        //                                 It provides an Enqueue() method to add values and a Dequeue() method to retrieve values from the collection.

        //         Stack<T>	            Stack<T> stores the values as LIFO (Last In First Out). 
        //                                 It provides a Push() method to add a value and Pop() & Peek() methods to retrieve values.

        //         Hashset<T>	            Hashset<T> contains non-duplicate elements. It eliminates duplicate elements.

        //         NON-GENERIC COLLECTIONS

        //         Non-generic collections	Usage
        //         ArrayList	            ArrayList stores objects of any type like an array. However, there is no need to specify the size of the ArrayList like with an array as it grows automatically.
        //         SortedList	            SortedList stores key and value pairs. It automatically arranges elements in ascending order of key by default. C# includes both, generic and non-generic SortedList collection.
        //         Stack	                Stack stores the values in LIFO style (Last In First Out). It provides a Push() method to add a value and Pop() & Peek() methods to retrieve values. C# includes both, generic and non-generic Stack.
        //         Queue	                Queue stores the values in FIFO style (First In First Out). It keeps the order in which the values were added. It provides an Enqueue() method to add values and a Dequeue() method to retrieve values from the collection. C# includes generic and non-generic Queue.
        //         Hashtable	            Hashtable stores key and value pairs. It retrieves the values by comparing the hash value of the keys.
        //         BitArray	            BitArray manages a compact array of bit values, which are represented as Booleans, where true indicates that the bit is on (1) and false indicates the bit is off (0).
