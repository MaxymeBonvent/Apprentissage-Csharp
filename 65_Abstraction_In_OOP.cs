        //        The dictionary meaning of abstraction is "existing as an idea, feeling, or 
        //        quality, not as a material object" (Source).

        //         Abstraction is a higher-level concept or a way of thinking when you start 
        //         designing your application from the business requirement. Abstraction is a 
        //         process of identifying essential entities (classes) and their 
        //         characteristics (class members) and leaving irrelevant information from the 
        //         business requirement to prepare a higher-level application design.

        //         Abstraction starts with identifying nouns in the business requirement or 
        //         feature request. A noun is a person, place, thing, or process. These nouns 
        //         can be your entities. After figuring out the required entities you can then 
        //         collect the relevant characteristics of each entity. Characteristics are 
        //         information (data) and behaviors (methods) relevant to each entity.

        //     */

        //     /*
        //         For example, consider the following simple business requirement: 

        //         We require a basic learning management system to store student, course, and 
        //         teacher data. We should be able to know which student has enrolled for which 
        //         course and who is the teacher for that course.

        //         In the above business requirement, we identify these nouns: student, course, 
        //         teacher. These are our entities at the design level which can be implemented 
        //         as classes.

        //         Now, we can identify essential characteristics for each of these entities 
        //         which can be implemented as properties or methods in each class. For example, 
        //         a student has a name, address, and email. They might be doing some extra 
        //         curriculum activities and they can have different skin colors, religions, etc.

        //         Now, out of this information, we have to pick characteristics that are 
        //         relevant and essential to our application. So, we can now pick the name, 
        //         address, and courses he or she enrolled in. We will leave other information 
        //         as they are not relevant for our application such as skin color, religion, 
        //         and extra curriculum activities.

        //         Thus, the process of identifying entities and characteristics which can be 
        //         classes and their members from the business requirement is called 
        //         "Abstraction".
